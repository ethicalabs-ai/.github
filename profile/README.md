## 📝 Code of Conduct  

At **ethicalabs.ai**, creating ethical, responsible AI also means fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and collaborative environment for all contributors. I’ve outlined clear community standards in the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure respectful, professional interactions.  

This reflects my commitment to ethical principles, not just in technology but also in how we work together. It’s essential to align our behavior with the same fairness, empathy, and integrity we expect from AI systems.
